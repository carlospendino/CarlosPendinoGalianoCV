Hypermedia Projec:


UserProfile: The persona of my website, are different videogame companies that are interested
on recruting new people with experience, so mainly the website is oriented to attract the attention of thouse videogame companies.

Information architecture: The webpage is constructed like any curriculum vitae. On the upper part of the webpage, my name is placed as a title. 
Next to the title is the specialization I form part, in this case Video Game Developer. In the top left corner, there is a profile picture of myself that shows how I look. 
In the center of the webpage is the main core of the CV, there is little information about me that sums up who I am. 
Next, there is information about my labral experience that explains my labral trajectory. After that we can find other information such as my known programming languages.
At the right part of the webpage there is some personal information that can be useful to contact me, and other information about the degree I have.

Visual design: The webpage is constructed to be simple reading and no oversaturated, due to this fact, I chose to use simple typographies and a simple construction and distribution structure.
As I have said earlier the webpage needed to be simple reading this meant that I had to construct the web having in mind that, the people that read the webpage could get all the information just by a simple glance,
due to this the webpage is distributed with a photo on the left side, the main information in the middle and some extra data on the right side. 
The colors I have selected are blues and some beige yellows, that's because I wanted to use colors that represented calm and peace. Also, I like the blue a lot and I thought it could suit perfectly in this situation.
To indicate the end of the webpage, there is a line with the same color as the title that indicates the end of the curriculum. And those are all the different design decisions I have made.
